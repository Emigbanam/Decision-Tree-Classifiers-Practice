# Decision Tree Classifier Practice

This repository contains my hands-on exercises and practice files on **Decision Tree Classification**. It is part of my learning journey in mastering supervised machine learning algorithms.

---

## 📌 Purpose

To build a solid understanding of decision tree models by:

* Implementing classifiers using real datasets
* Practicing model training, prediction, and evaluation
* Exploring feature importance and decision boundaries
* Applying scikit-learn’s `DecisionTreeClassifier`

---

## 📁 Contents

* `breast_cancer_classification.ipynb`:
  Classification of breast tumors as malignant or benign using the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset.


---

## 🧠 Concepts Practiced

* Gini impurity and entropy
* Overfitting and tree depth control
* Train-test splitting
* Accuracy, precision, recall
* Visualizing trees with `plot_tree()`
* Handling categorical vs numerical features

---

## 🛠 Tools Used

* Python 3
* Jupyter Notebook
* pandas, numpy
* scikit-learn
* matplotlib, seaborn

---
